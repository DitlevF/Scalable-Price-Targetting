# Scalable-Price-Targetting
Code for the Seminar Paper on Scalable Price Targetting by Frederik Melchiorsen and Ditlev Kiersgaard Frisch


This is the code for our seminar paper on Scalable Price Targetting. The file "Seminar in Bayesian Econometrics..." is a zip-file containing four files to run in the following order:

1. Run the blasso_probit_func 
2. Run the Generate Data....
3. Run the WLB & BLasso Plot
4. Run the Bayes factor

In addition to the zip-file, you can also find generic R code for the different steps, which are refered to in the paper.
