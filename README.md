# Scalable-Price-Targetting
Code for the Seminar Paper on Scalable Price Targetting by Frederik Melchiorsen and Ditlev Kiersgaard Frisch.


The file "Seminar in Bayesian Econometrics..." is a zip-file containing four files to run in the following order:

1. Run the blasso_probit_func 
2. Run the Generate Data....
3. Run the WLB & BLasso Plot
4. Run the Bayes factor

In addition to the zip-file, you can also find R code for the Bayesian Probit-augmented Lasso, WLB and Bayes factors as well as a generic simulation of the data, which are hyper-refered to in the paper.
